    WhatsApp is one of the most used messenger applications today with more than 2 Billion users worldwide. It was found that more than 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp daily so we can use WhatsApp chats for analyzing our chat with a friend, customer, or a group of people.
   This Web App gives a detailed report about the WhatsApp Group Chats. 
   It takes the chats text file generated by WhatsApp export (without media), preprocesses the data, deletes the file uploaded, and generates the stats report.
